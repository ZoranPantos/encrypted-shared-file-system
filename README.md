# Cryptography project

- application uses Windows NTFS to create its own file system
- users can register, login and share files with other users
- private files are encrypted with symmetric encryption
- shared files are also encrypted with symmetric encryption but symmetric keys are stored in digital envelope by using asymmetric encryption
- interaction is pretty bare-bone and is done with console
- amateur simulation of certificate authority is present
